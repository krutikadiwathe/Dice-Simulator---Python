üé≤ Dice Roller Program
Welcome to this simple yet fun Dice Roller program! This script lets you roll a six-sided dice as many times as you want, giving you a fresh random number with every roll. It's great for board games, decision-making, or just for fun when you're feeling lucky. 
This project contains two Python programs for simulating dice rolls. Each program employs a different coding style to accomplish the same task. These programs are designed to help users understand various approaches to writing Python code and simulating random events.


‚ú® Features
Roll a dice: Generates a random number between 1 and 6, just like rolling a real six-sided dice.
Keep rolling: After each roll, you can choose whether you want to roll again.
Interactive: Simple input-based program, with prompts that allow you to decide when to stop rolling.


üöÄ How to Run the Program
Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x is recommended).

Run the script by navigating to the directory where the file is saved, then type:

python dice.py  # or dice2.py
It will start rolling the dice right away!


üìÇ Files in the Repository
dice.py: The first version of the dice roller program.
dice2.py: A second version of the dice roller, with similar functionality.


üí° How it Works
This program uses Python‚Äôs random.randint(1, 6) function to simulate a dice roll, which gives you a random number between 1 and 6 every time.
After each roll, it waits for your input:
If you type "y", it rolls again.
If you type "n", the program stops.
Super simple and easy!


üéØ Why Use This Program?
For Fun: Use it for any board game where you need a dice but don‚Äôt have one handy.
For Decision Making: Can‚Äôt decide what to do? Let the dice roll decide your fate!
For Learning: A great small project to understand how loops and conditionals work in Python.


‚ö†Ô∏è Note
The program will keep running and asking you if you want to roll again until you type "n".
Make sure you type carefully, otherwise it might not understand your input. üòÑ


üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements
Some fun ideas to add:

Roll multiple dice at once.
Add more sides to the dice, like a 20-sided dice (D20) for RPG games.
Keep track of the results of each roll and show a history at the end.


‚öñÔ∏è License
This program is free for everyone to use, modify, and enjoy! Happy rolling!
